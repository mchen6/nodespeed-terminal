# nodeSpeed Terminal 

Implementation of [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org) as an Express application using Golden Layout for multiple terminals in the same browse tab. 

nodeSpeed Terminal is an integrated part of the [nodeSpeed Development](https://github.com/whoGloo/nodespeed-development) project. 

## Features
- All the features from [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org) 
- [Golden Layout](https://www.golden-layout.com) implementation for multiple terminals in the same session
- Authentication and sign-in using [Auth0](https://auth0.com) 

## Usage
It should also be possible to use stand-alone. Because of the integrated authentication, there are some dependencies on environment variables that need to be set before you can start. These will be documented later. 

## Development and Contribution

nodeSpeed Terminal is maintained by [whoGloo](https://whogloo.com/) and a few external contributors, but we would love to receive contributions from everyone!

To contribute either code, documentation or issues please read the [Contributing document](CONTRIBUTING.md) beforehand. The development of nodeSpeed Terminal does not require any special tool. All you need is an editor that supports JavaScript/TypeScript and a browser. You will need Node.js installed locally to get all the features working in the demo.
